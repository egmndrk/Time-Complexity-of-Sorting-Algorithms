# Time Complexity of Sorting Algorithms
 This project aims to assess and contrast the effectiveness of three sorting algorithms: Radix Sort, Quicksort, Insertion Sort

In computer science, sorting is a basic function, and the effectiveness of different applications can be greatly impacted by the sorting algorithm selected. These algorithms are options of performance analysis because of their different time complexity.

Sorting algorithms are widely used in data processing and analysis, it is important to examine how well they function. Selecting the sorting algorithm can result in considerable time and resource savings, depending on the causes of the problem.

The following table presents the execution times (in seconds) of the three sorting algorithms for various array sizes:

 In summary, the choice of algorithm depends on the specific problem and data characteristics and the complexity of algorithms like Quicksort and Radix Sort can make them highly efficient for specific use cases, while Insertion Sort may be less suitable for larger datasets due to its higher time complexity.
